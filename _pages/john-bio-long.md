I'm currently a Machine Learning Research Engineer at Scale AI, building "models as a service" for enterprise customers interesting in GenAI applications. Recently, I was an Applied Scientist at Amazon (scientist by title, engineer at heart <3) for 3 years, where I worked on question answering for Alexa (now the ~AGI~ organization). I'm interested in agents, information retrieval, safety, evaluation -- all the things. I've trained the occasional language model of the large variety.

Prior to joining Amazon, I got my Bachelor's and MEng degrees in Computer Science at MIT. I was a TA for the wildly popular [Intro to Machine Learning course](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/course/) for several semesters -- I love to teach, and still tutor in some capacity, but I wish I spent more time teaching! I've also taught ML to high schoolers at [Inspirit](https://www.inspiritai.com/).

I did undergrad research in MIT's Lab of Nuclear Science working with (or _learning from_, mostly) [Gabriel Collin](https://ghc.ac/). I don't have a background in physics, but fumbled together some code to prototype a few ML/stats experiments with physics applications. I worked with Gabriel again on my [MEng thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/127407), in which we used Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to characterize (simulated) distributions of point sources in the X-ray sky.

I briefly worked with [Curtis Northcutt](https://www.curtisnorthcutt.com/) developing emotionally-intelligent AI at [Chipbrain](https://chipbrain.com/). Check out Curtis and team's latest work at [Cleanlab](https://cleanlab.ai/)!
