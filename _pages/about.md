Hi! I'm currently a Machine Learning Research Engineer at Scale AI, building "models as a service" for enterprise customers interesting in GenAI applications. Recently, I was an Applied Scientist at Amazon (scientist by title, engineer at heart <3) for 3 years, where I worked on question answering for Alexa (now the ~AGI~ organization). I'm interested in agents, information retrieval, safety, evaluation -- all the things. I've trained the occasional language model of the large variety.
